## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Myself Himesh, a passionate developer who likes to creates tools which helps people in their everyday life

## What this repository does

This is my GitHub profile repository that automatically generates and displays animated visualizations of my GitHub contributions. Here's what it does:

- **Automated Snake Animation**: Uses GitHub Actions to generate snake-like animations that "eat" my contribution graph
- **Daily Updates**: Runs automatically every day at midnight UTC to keep the animations current
- **Theme Support**: Generates both light and dark mode versions of the animations
- **Visual Contribution History**: Transforms the standard GitHub contribution graph into an engaging animated display

The snake animation is created using the [Platane/snk](https://github.com/Platane/snk) action and is displayed right here in this README!
